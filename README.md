# Weather-Prediction_CNN
Prediction of weather using CNN. CNN performance compared with classic method SARIMAX and HWES predictors.

# Model
CNN is used in order the predict the weather data. The trained model's performance is then compared with the classic ML models SARIMAX and HWES predictors.

It can a deduced that even a simple CNN outperforms classic models for time series forcasting

# Tools
The model was developed using PyTorch which provides greater customization and debugging option.
